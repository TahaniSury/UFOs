 ## Summary:
 
 . drawback:
  I noticed the when searched word (FRESNO)instead of (fresno) it did not show up that is mean it's a case sensitive 
  
 . additional recommendations for further developmen:
 . I think it's better to put a button to click for example (search button ) is more clear to use than just write the word and hit enter
